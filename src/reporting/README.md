# NFL QB Analysis Reporting Module

This module provides comprehensive PDF reporting capabilities for the NFL QB Analysis pipeline. It enables the generation of professional, detailed reports that can be shared with non-technical stakeholders.

## Features

- PDF report generation using FPDF library
- Professional layout with header, footer, and structured sections
- Integration of data tables, text, and visualizations
- Executive summary with key findings at a glance
- Detailed methodology section to explain the analysis process
- In-depth quarterback performance analysis
- Actionable recommendations for team management and coaching staff
- Technical appendix with implementation details

## Report Structure

The generated reports include the following sections:

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of the key findings
2. **Analysis Methodology**: Explanation of the data collection and analysis process
3. **Key Findings**: Detailed insights from the analysis
4. **Detailed QB Analysis**: In-depth breakdown of quarterback performance
5. **Visual Insights**: Graphical representations of quarterback metrics
6. **Actionable Recommendations**: Practical suggestions based on the analysis
7. **Real-Time Pipeline Concept**: Proposal for implementing near real-time analysis
8. **Technical Appendix**: Additional technical details and limitations

## Usage

### From Main Pipeline

The reporting module is integrated into the main NFL QB analysis pipeline. To generate a report when running the pipeline, include the "report" step:

```bash
python src/main.py --steps collect process metric analyze visualize report
```

Or to run just the report generation step (assuming previous steps have been completed):

```bash
python src/main.py --steps report
```

### Independent Testing

You can test the report generation independently using the test script:

```bash
python src/reporting/test_report.py --season 2023 --data-dir ./data
```

This will generate a report using existing analysis data without running the entire pipeline.

## Dependencies

- FPDF: For PDF generation
- Pandas: For data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualization handling
- NumPy: For numerical operations

## Customization

The report layout, sections, and content can be customized by modifying the methods in the `QBReportGenerator` class. The `QBPDF` class (extending FPDF) can be modified to change the document styling.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the reporting module include:

- Interactive PDF elements for enhanced user experience
- Customizable report templates for different audience needs
- Executive vs. Technical report versions
- Automated delivery options (email, cloud storage, etc.)
- Integration with real-time data streams
